Tea App

"The Tea Tree"

##About this App##
"The Tea Tree"

Are you a tea lover? As an avid tea lover, I wanted to create an application where you can view different types of drinking tea, and be able to save your favorites to your "Tea Tree".

This is a full stack application, that allows a user to create an account, and select Teas to put in their database.

**User Stories**
When a user arrives at the homepage, they are prompted to enter. They are then brought to a page where they can create a new account.

When a user creates an account, they are brought to their personalized page, where they can see their information, update their account, and even delete their account.

When a user is creating their account, they can also see a list of all users that are currently using the weather app.

**Technologies Used:**
This app uses the MEHN stack, full CRUD methods. Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Handlebars.

**Future Goals**
A stretch goal is to be able to add user authentication to the site, so that users will be able to have a log in, and save their individual teas. I would also like for users to be able to create and save different teas.
